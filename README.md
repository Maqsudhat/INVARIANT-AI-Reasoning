 INVARIANT
Mathematical Invariants for Verifiable AI Reasoning in Security Applications

This repository hosts ongoing research on invariant-preserving reasoning for AI systems, with a focus on verifiability, security, and mathematical structure preservation.

The central premise of this work is that many failures of modern AI systems—particularly large language models—do not arise from lack of capability, but from violations of fundamental invariants during multi-step reasoning. While outputs may appear plausible, underlying mathematical, graph-theoretic, or information-theoretic properties are often silently broken.

INVARIANT reframes AI evaluation around a principle long used in mathematics, formal methods, and security engineering: reasoning is only valid if invariants are preserved at every transformation step.

This project is currently in the preprint and prototyping stage. The repository reflects active research rather than a finalized system. Code, benchmarks, and experimental results are subject to change as the framework is refined.
